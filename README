# Release notes for sonR_1.2:

# 1. Added the functions readProfosPP() and plotProfosPP() for reading/processing and plotting per ping output files from profos (one line per ping per school.

# 2. Minor change in rotate3D(), where NAs in the rotation angles now result in NAs in the output (before these resulted in no rotation by default).

# 3. Fixed bug in read.event_unzip_vbsc(), where setting dimension to vbsc failed when lenb and numb were missing. Now setting dimension is only done if these are present.

# 4. Fixed bug in compr.event().

# 5. Added the functions EKRaw2TSDs(), getSchoolsFromWork() and aggregateSchoolsFromWork() which batch convert Simrad raw files to TSD, reads schools from sonar Work files, and aggregates these schools from several events, respectively.
