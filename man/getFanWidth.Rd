\title{Calculates the width of a 2-D sonar fan given the specifications in the parameter fanWidth. Only one time step is treated.}
\usage{
getFanWidth(data, fanWidth, stretch = 1, range = 0, ind = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The list of inputs variables as returned from read.TSD (including ).}

\item{fanWidth}{Has a number of possible values: (1) "b1": one way beam width. (2) "b2": two way beam width. (3) "fe": beams modeled by rectangular cones with width withing the fan given by the inter-beam angle, and calculated using the equivalent beam angle. This normally causes larged fan width due to overlap between beams.}

\item{stretch}{Used to stretch the voxels of the ME70 multibeam echosounder in the direction of motion, so that space in between voxels is smoothed out.}

\item{range}{The range at which this stretch value is as desired}

\item{ind}{The indices of the beams to treat (such as data$rect).}
