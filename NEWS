########## Version 1.0 ##########

Library for reading, processing (noise estimation, segmentation) and converting sonar data to the TSD format. Contains many functions used by the packages echoIBM and cpplot3d.


########## Version 1.1 ##########

Changed read.event() to return a matrix of the segmentation mask, containing voxel indices, positions and sv.

Moved development to GitHub.


########## Version 1.2 ##########

Added the functions readProfosPP() and plotProfosPP() for reading/processing and plotting per ping output files from profos (one line per ping per school.

Minor change in rotate3D(), where NAs in the rotation angles now result in NAs in the output (before these resulted in no rotation by default).

Fixed bug in read.event_unzip_vbsc(), where setting dimension to vbsc failed when lenb and numb were missing. Now setting dimension is only done if these are present.

Fixed bug in compr.event().

Added the functions EKRaw2TSDs(), getSchoolsFromWork() and aggregateSchoolsFromWork() which batch convert Simrad raw files to TSD, reads schools from sonar Work files, and aggregates these schools from several events, respectively.
